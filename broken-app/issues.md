# Broken App Issues
Lack of Error Handling: The original code did not handle API errors effectively, which could lead to crashes or incorrect responses when GitHub API requests failed.

Rate Limiting: There was no implementation of rate limiting, which could potentially lead to exceeding GitHub's API rate limits and causing requests to fail.

Code Structure: The original code lacked a clear structure, making it challenging to maintain and understand. It was necessary to refactor the code into smaller, more modular components to improve readability and maintainability.

Validation: There was no validation of incoming data, specifically the developers array in the request body. This could lead to unexpected errors or misuse of the API if invalid data was provided. Adding validation ensures that the API handles valid inputs appropriately.
